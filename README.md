# ðŸŽ¯ Student Score Predictor using Linear Regression

This project uses a simple linear regression model to predict student exam scores based on the number of hours studied.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- Synthetic dataset with two columns: `Hours Studied` and `Scores`
- Clean and ideal for learning basic ML regression concepts

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- Google Colab

## ðŸš€ What It Does
- Visualizes the relationship between hours studied and scores
- Trains a regression model using scikit-learn
- Predicts scores for new input (e.g., 9.25 hours)
- Evaluates performance using MAE, MSE, RMSE

## âœ… How to Run
Just open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook and run all cells!
